# Covid-SIM
<p>This is an epidemic simulator for the Americas that my team members and I created based on the SIR transmission model.</p>
<p>You can run the simulation by running main.py</p>
<p>The following is a demonstration of the infectious results obtained by running main.py</p>
<p>Each blue dot represents a state, and the contagion between states is connected by red lines</p>
